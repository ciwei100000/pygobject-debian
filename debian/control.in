Description: Python bindings for the GObject library
 GObject is an abstraction layer that allows to program with an object 
 paradigm that is compatible with many languages. It is a part of Glib, 
 the core library used to build GTK+ and GNOME.
 .
 This package contains the python bindings for GObject. It is mostly 
 used by other bindings to map their GObjects to python objects.
