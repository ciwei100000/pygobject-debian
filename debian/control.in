Description: Python bindings for the GObject library
 GObject is an abstraction layer that allows programming with an object
 paradigm that is compatible with many languages. It is a part of Glib,
 the core library used to build GTK+ and GNOME.
 .
 This package contains the Python bindings for GObject. It is mostly
 used by other bindings to map their GObjects to Python objects.

Description: Development headers for the GObject Python bindings
 GObject is an abstraction layer that allows programming with an object
 paradigm that is compatible with many languages. It is a part of Glib,
 the core library used to build GTK+ and GNOME.
 .
 This package contains the development headers needed to build
 other Python bindings relying on pygobject.

Description: Python bindings for the GObject library (debug extension)
 GObject is an abstraction layer that allows programming with an object
 paradigm that is compatible with many languages. It is a part of Glib,
 the core library used to build GTK+ and GNOME.
 .
 This package contains the Python bindings for GObject. It is mostly
 used by other bindings to map their GObjects to Python objects.
 .
 This package contains the extensions built for the Python debug interpreter.
