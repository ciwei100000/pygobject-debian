Description: Python 3 bindings for gobject-introspection libraries
 GObject is an abstraction layer that allows programming with an object
 paradigm that is compatible with many languages. It is a part of Glib,
 the core library used to build GTK+ and GNOME.
 .
 This package contains the Python 3 binding generator for libraries that
 support gobject-introspection, i. e. which ship a gir1.2-<name>-<version>
 package. With these packages, the libraries can be used from Python 3.

Description: development headers for GObject Python bindings
 GObject is an abstraction layer that allows programming with an object
 paradigm that is compatible with many languages. It is a part of Glib,
 the core library used to build GTK+ and GNOME.
 .
 This package contains the development headers needed to build C extensions
 which use pygobject.

Description: Python 3 Cairo bindings for the GObject library
 GObject is an abstraction layer that allows programming with an object
 paradigm that is compatible with many languages. It is a part of Glib,
 the core library used to build GTK+ and GNOME.
 .
 This package contains the Python 3 Cairo bindings for GObject. It is mostly
 used by other bindings to map their GObjects to Python objects.
